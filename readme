This is a quick POC to see if I could replicate the look of the the Daft Punk helmet LEDs.  As such, I was only concerned with the performance in modern Webkit browsers.  Lights are generated using multiple webkit repeating linear gradients.  Colors derived from a YouTube video.  The patterns morph organically as the result of randomizing the webkit animation duration property.  Sweeping camera-style animation achieved by animating the rotation property on light container.  

Put some Daft Punk on and watch the bars dance.
